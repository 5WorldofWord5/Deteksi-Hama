# Pest-Detection
Pest Detection is a system based on Computer Vision and Machine Learning designed to automatically detect and classify plant pests through leaf images. This system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze visual patterns such as color, texture, and leaf damage characteristics caused by pests.
